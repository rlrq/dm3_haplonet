# dm3_haplonet
data and script for generating haplotype network in DM3 paper

## DM3 haplotype2.fasta
* DM3 CDS sequences were downloaded using 1001 Genomes API and translated
* Unknown residues were encoded as wild-type
* Peptide sequences were encoded as nucleotide sequences for compaitibility with pegas
  * Wild-type residue is encoded as A
  * All non-wild-type residues are arbitrarily encoded as other nucleotides, consistent on a per-position basis
* Haplotype sequences in FASTA file are duplicated according to frequency across accessions
  * <10 accessions: 1 copy in FASTA file
  * 10-99 accessions: 2 copies in FASTA file
  * \>100 accessions: 3 copies in FASTA file

## Notes
* Haplotype network generated by haploNet appears to be dependent on order of sequences in input FASTA file. Sorting sequences by name results in a different haplotype network even if actual sequences are identical.
* Output plot was manually annotated to obtain the final version.
